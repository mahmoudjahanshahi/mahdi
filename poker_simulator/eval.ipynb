    "# Assignment #7 - Hand Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The other part of the project that you will do is write some of the code to evaluate and compare hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ultimate goal in this step is to write a function, which when passed two hands of cards, determines which one won (or if they tied). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major steps to determining who won:\n",
    "1. Figuring out what ranking each hand has (straight, flush, etc)\n",
    "2. Figuring out which 5 cards make up the hand (picking out the 5 cards that made the flush, or the two pairs and tiebreaker)\n",
    "3. Comparing the rankings, and if they are the same, breaking ties by comparing the values in the hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might be thinking that there is going to\n",
    "be a lot of code to write with all the different possible\n",
    "arrangements of cards and different possible hand rankings.\n",
    "However, there are a few important things that will make\n",
    "this managable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will start by sorting the  cards into descending order by value. This makes it much easier to find straights (cards in order), and you will have \"N of a kind\"s grouped together.\n",
    "2. The code to find \"N of a kind\" is basically the same for 4, 3, and 2 (so we can abstract it out into a function...)\n",
    "3. Full house and two pair are just three of a kind and a pair (so we already have that code...) with another pair (so we can just write a function to find a secondary pair)\n",
    "4. We are going to make two simplifying assumptions:\n",
    "    - if there is a flush, it will occur in at most one suit. (i.e., you won't have As Ah Kh Qs 8s 7h 4s 3s 3h 2h, which has two different flushes).\n",
    "    - if there is an ace-high straight, there is not also an ace-low straight. (These both hold for all major poker variants)\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. : from now on, for each function, you have to write your own test cases as it is one of the most important tasks for debugging your code."
