There are MANY valid ways to shuffle a deck of cards---I'll leave the specifics of the algorithm design up to you. However, you will want to use a function to generate pseudo-random numbers. Several packages offer random generating functions and you are free to choose any of them. For example, numpy is a useful package which also has [random generation functions](https://numpy.org/doc/1.16/reference/routines.random.html). You should take a small number of cards, and think about ways to shuffle them that involve using random numbers to swap their order, or pick positions for them, or similar principles."
