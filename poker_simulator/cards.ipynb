    "In a poker game, we have 52 individual cards. Each card has a **value** and a **suit**.\n",
    "Values can be between 2 to 14 inclusive. 11 corresponds to Jack, 12 to Queen, 13 to King and 14 to Ace.  \n",
    "There are 4 suits, being **clubs**, **diamonds**, **hearts** and **spades**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we will represent each card in three ways, by a number between 1 and 52 (c_n), by a list of [value, suit] (c_l) or by a string of value and suit concatenated (c_s).  \n",
    "In 52 number representation (0 - 51), the first 13 cards will be Spades, the second 13 Hearts, the third 13 Diamonds and the 4th Clubs.  \n",
    "In list representation, values are represented by a number between 2 to 14 and suits with a number between 0 to 3. corresponding to the order spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs.  \n",
    "In string representation, we have exactly one symbol for the value and one for the suits. For values, 0 corresponds to 10, J to Jack, Q to Queen, K to King and A to Ace. For suits, s corresponds to Spades, h to Hearts, d to Diamonds and c to Clubs.  \n",
